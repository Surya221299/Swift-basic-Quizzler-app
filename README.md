- Give user feedback using green color if user correct the answer and red color if the user choose the wrong answer using **IF/ELSE Conditionals.**
- **Count point +=1** if the user choose the correct answer.
- Calculate and Update the Progress View using **Float**Number calculation and **updateUI** function.
- Implementing **MVC Design Pattern** to be able to build more complex app and working with Parameter.
